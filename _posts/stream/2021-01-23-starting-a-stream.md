Inspired by the idea of [streams, campfires and gardens](https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/10/of-gardens-and-wikis/), I’m going to experiment with starting my own stream&nbsp;—&nbsp;posting short thoughts, links or ideas a few times a week. 

I still plan to write longer posts once or twice a month.

And I’ll be working on a bit of a redesign and splitting the RSS feeds in due time.
