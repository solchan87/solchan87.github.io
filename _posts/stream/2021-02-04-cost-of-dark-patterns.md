And another look at LinkedIn. This time when accessing the website via my phone.

This screen frustrates me for a few reasons: 
1. It’s bad UX writing.
2. It uses the principles of UX to nudge people into doing something they probably don’t want to do. 
3. Dozens of people had a hand in making this at the cost of doing something beneficial for the product or humanity at large. 
4. Some PM hit their vanity metric (app downloads) at the cost of a better product.
