This whole pandemic thing has shown how religions are born. Even staunchly secular types like *the Guardian* are essentially arguing that [Covid is divine punishment for sinners](https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2021/feb/01/loose-rule-breaking-culture-covid-deaths-societies-pandemic). 

Ignore the fact that culturally similar countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and US) have had vastly different outcomes. Nope, it’s not incompetent leadership and poverty (lockdowns are for the rich, after all). Peasants who get corona just didn’t follow the rules.
