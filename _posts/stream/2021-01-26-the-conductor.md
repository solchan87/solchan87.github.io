Seth Godin’s blog provides something to think about nearly every single day. For instance, [Famous Conductors](https://seths.blog/2021/01/famous-conductors/): 

> [Conductors] wear expensive clothes, make dramatic gestures and receive ovations. They also get paid a lot to carry a very little stick and they’re the only one on stage who doesn’t make noise.
>
> But it turns out that none of these things are what makes a great conductor.

It’s always worth remembering that much of the *real* work goes on behind the scenes and what we judge is often unrelated to it.
