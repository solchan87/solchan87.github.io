Imagine if all managers were kept on an island four days a week. They’d give each other presentations about leadership, congratulate each other, pour our over spreadsheets, talk about mentorship and growth. The only catch is that it’s a retreat&thinsp;—&thinsp;no contact with their teams.

The productivity and happiness gains among their teams would be unprecedented. And then the following week, the managers could talk about how their leadership brought about this uptick in productivity.
