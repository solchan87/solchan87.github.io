I’m reading *The Laws of Human Nature* by Robert Greene. 

One of the main points is that all of us, no matter how rational we think we are, get caught up in non-rational biases, tribal thinking and everything we accuse *other* people of doing. It’s a good read for some self-reflection and to also understand where other people are usually coming from. 

Along those lines, as a left-leaning American here’s a prime example of where we virtue signal: [*California is making liberals squirm*](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/11/opinion/california-san-francisco-schools.html).
