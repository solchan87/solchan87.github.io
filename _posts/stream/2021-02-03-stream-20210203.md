An office prank led me to write a quick AppleScript (yes, we’re all nerds). Scanning through the documentation sparked an idea that was completely unrelated but helped solve a much bigger problem. Having an afternoon lull let the people who could move the solution for the bigger problem hack out a proof of concept. 

As optimization becomes the highest value, we’re killing the chance encounters that lead to creativity and innovation. If everything is optimized for today, there will never be enough resources for tomorrow’s opportunity.
