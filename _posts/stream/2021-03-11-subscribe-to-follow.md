And so Apple is following the trend and [changing the CTA on podcasts](https://jarango.com/2021/03/10/dont-subscribe-follow) from “subscribe” to “follow”. 

Listeners are building entire mental models around a single word. Subscribing costs money, following is free. 

Even though Apple invented the podcast and subscribing has always been free, there’s much point in fighting a quixotic battle against the dominant mental modal in the industry and the words connected to it.
