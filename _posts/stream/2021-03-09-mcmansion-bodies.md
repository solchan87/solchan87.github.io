[Everyone is beautiful and no one is horny](https://bloodknife.com/everyone-beautiful-no-one-horny/) is one of those great internet reads. 

The gist: 
1. Gratuitous violence fills our screens while Hollywood grows ever more prudish. 
2. Normal sex by regular people with realistic bodies in happy relationships just doesn’t happen on screen anymore. 
3. There’s a curious connection between the functionally useless McMansion (and the linked [McMansion Hell](https://mcmansionhell.com) had me literally laughing out loud) and ’roided up bodies that are unhealthy and equally useless.
4. Porn is the only place for sexuality and nudity in American culture. 

This is all rather curious and deeply unhealthy.
