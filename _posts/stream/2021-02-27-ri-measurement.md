Outside of scientific contexts, I’m just not a fan of the metric system. Feet and inches feel intuitive for most objects that I handle on a daily basis. 

Likewise Fahrenheit is more natural with a great range of degrees for the climates most people live in. Water freezing at zero and boiling at a hundred in Celsius doesn’t do anything to simplify my life. 

Along those lines is the *ri*. To quote [Craig Mod](https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/109/):

> A ri is a unit of measure, it’s about how far a person can walk in an hour at a reasonable pace. It clocks out at roughly 3.93 kilometers.

That’s a beautiful, intuitive measure. Measures were made for humans, not scientism.
