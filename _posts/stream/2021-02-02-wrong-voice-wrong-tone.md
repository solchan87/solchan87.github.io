Good UX writing is subtle and easy to overlook. Bad product writing is obvious. 

![Get the LinkedIn app and see more profiles like this person's anytime, anywhere](https://res.cloudinary.com/derekkedziora/image/upload/v1612284808/Blog%20Assets/2021-02-02/linkedin-voice_fw1mfh.png)

I’m looking at a new connection’s profile on LinkedIn. This text has the voice and tone of a dating app, not a professional tool. Even if it were properly targeted at a recruiter, the intent is not “profiles anytime, anywhere”, it’s to make it easier to view the *right* profiles. The last thing anybody wants is a work app open “anytime, anywhere”.
