Iâ€™m inspired by daily bloggers like [Seth Godin](https://seths.blog). Thus Iâ€™m *trying* to write more frequently: shorter posts with simpler ideas. Keeping it here rather than Twitter keeps with my love of small-b blogging and human scale internet. 

My daily stream of consciousness might not be what you want cluttering up your RSS feed. If youâ€™d like to read my frequent mini-posts, no need to do anything. The current feed will have everything I post. 

If youâ€™d prefer to only get longer posts once a month or so, subscribe to the new feed instead: [/feed/essays.xml](https://derekkedziora.com/feed/essays.xml). 

Thanks for using RSS, youâ€™re keeping the internet awesome! ðŸ¤“
