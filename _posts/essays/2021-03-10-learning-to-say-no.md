On of the hardest skills I’ve had to learn over the past few years has been saying no. Time, energy and life itself are all finite resources. Saying *yes* to something almost always means that you have to say *no* to something else. 

To quote from [Michael Stanier’s *the Coaching Habit*](/blog/advice-monster):

> A Yes is nothing without the No that gives it boundaries and form.

Over the past few years my yes-es have been piling up while still clinging to a bit of everything. My shelves are packed with books about teaching and linguistics. I can’t quite bring myself to admit that I’m probably never going to teach English again. 

My bookmarks are mostly programming tutorials. I still haven’t given up my dream of someday switching careers in that  direction. 

These gnawing doubts in the back of my head make me worse at my actual job as a UX Writer. Using my background as a teacher makes me a better mentor to new writers. A bit of technical know-how comes in handy. These are the boundaries and form that I need. 

There’s something much more satisfying in saying yes to being a product writer than being a teacher that always tried to force myself to like programming because that’s where the money is. 

Even on a more mundane level, it helps to consciously understand that saying yes is saying no. Saying yes to a conversation with someone *should* be a no to my phone, notifications and distractions. 

It’s taken me until the cusp of middle age to learn this lesson on a deeper level. Now’s the time to figure out what I want out of life, what I’m going to say yes to, and conversely what I’m going to step away from. 

You can’t have it all.
