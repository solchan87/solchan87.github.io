I like Apple products, even if I'm not a *bona fide* fanboy. I'm willing to pay more for a product that lasts longer and doesn't show me a constant stream of ads. That's why I'm not interested in Google or Amazon devices. As much as a Surface Pro temps me, the idea of ads embedded in the OS is too off putting for me to even consider Windows. 

Lo and behold, look what Apple's doing in iOS's Books App.

When you leave a book that youâ€™re currently reading, by default you're taken to this new 'Reading Now' page, which is essentially an ad platform for buying Apple Books. As far as I can tell, there's no way to override this setting and go straight to your library.  

I mean, this isn't a deal breaker, and it's certainly not worse than what's lurking on literally every other OS out there. Nonetheless, it's disappointing. Apple, you can do better, and that's precisely why you have so many loyal customers willing to pay premium prices. 

More generally, I'm tired of seeing ads after I've paid for something. Not long ago I took a taxi that had tablets with ads blaring the whole ride. Every square inch of the Bangkok metro was devoted to selling something or other. Truly non-commercial spaces have become nearly impossible to find.
