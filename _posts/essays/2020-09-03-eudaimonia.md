I stumbled across this book about the [Buddhist-Aristotelian synthesis](https://www.existentialbuddhist.com/2019/12/towards-a-buddhist-aristotelian-synthesis/). The conclusion, somehow both obvious and unexpected, is that Western Buddhism is mostly Aristotelian [eudaimonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudaimonia) grafted on to a Buddhist background.  

It's unexpected in the sense that I had never thought of my own practice in those terms, but it makes sense the more I think about it. 

We can neatly divide Buddhist teachers into those teaching a metaphysical nibbana and those teaching eudaimonia (with a full range of agnosticism to outright rejection of metaphysical nibbana).   

I'd put [Ajahn Buddhadasa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhadasa) squarely into the camp of eudaimonia teachers. 

[Ajahn Thanissaro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ṭhānissaro_Bhikkhu) is one of the most vocal proponents of a metaphysical nibbana.

In terms of *practice*, the two are virtually identical.  

The Buddha himself allowed for a eudaimonic interpretation of the practice in the [*Samaññaphala Sutta*](https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/DN/DN02.html) when asked: 

> Is it possible, lord, to point out a similar fruit of the contemplative life, visible in the here and now?

The response begins with a strong affirmative: 

> Yes, it is, great king…

And goes on to detail the entire [Gradual Training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradual_training). The practice itself generates peace and happiness that make it a worthwhile pursuit in the here and now, not just for a metaphysically distant reward. 

Nonetheless, there's an ironclad case that [the Buddha wasn't a materialist](https://accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/truth_of_rebirth.html), even if a materialist can make progress along the path. 

I don't see a problem with an Aristotelian or Eudaimonic Buddhism. Zen is a Daoist reworking of Indian Buddhism, so why shouldn't Western Buddhism go through the same process? 

The better question is, why should a westerner (or a modern Thai or Sri Lankan) concern themselves with Buddhism when there are philosophical schools more directly in tune with eudaimonia as a goal (and without any metaphysical baggage)? 

Buddhism is a lived tradition. Stoicism is an academic rival. 

The eightfold path is a powerful method for giving meaning to life and producing eudaimonia. Even in traditional Buddhism, it's perfectly acceptable to *not* shoot only for nibbana. 

When I talk to other Western Buddhists, it's easy to think that the practice is only retreats and intense meditation. A stronger emphasis on flourishing and happiness in the here and now would add some much needed balance to Western Buddhist practice.
