NPR has a great piece comparing Spotify to Bandcamp: [A Tale of Two Ecosystems](https://www.npr.org/2020/08/19/903547253/a-tale-of-two-ecosystems-on-bandcamp-spotify-and-the-wide-open-future). 

Spotify embodies the VC model: not really profitable and and becoming so hinges on basically the entire planet becoming a Spotify user. For artists it's also a losing proposition. All but the most popular are making pennies. 

Bandcamp is a place to *buy* music. It's profitable, and even small time artists make decent money. 

Spotify is about mindless engagement. Bandcamp is about mindful curation. 

This is precisely the point I wanted to make about [too much UX being bad design](/blog/product-design). Spotify will win all the UX awards, but I see it as a fundamentally flawed product. The VC types scoff at Bandcamp, yet it's created real wealth for itself and artists. 

I suppose the difference is ideological. The Bandcamps are digital tools in the real world, the Spotifies are all about fantasy separated from the real world. 

Anyway, I decided to stop streaming awhile back and instead buy an album or two every month. Why not buy from Bandcamp? This month's purchase: [Kaleidoscope](https://flamingpines.bandcamp.com/album/kaleidoscope), a collection of experimental music from Ukraine.
