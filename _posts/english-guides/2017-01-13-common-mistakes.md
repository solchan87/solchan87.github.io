My list is definitely not exhaustive, but here's a few of the more common 'slavicisms' I hear. 
 
## bring / take

Bring always shows motion towards the speaker, while take shows motion going away from the speaker.

> My wife told me to **take** an umbrella with me when I left for work.       

Now that I'm at the office: 

> Since it rained, I was glad that I had **brought** my umbrella to the office. 

If I'm not longer at work: 

> It's a good thing I **took** my umbrella to work today.

Note that "with you" can be dropped when it's clear from context.

## go / come / get

Similarly, *come* shows movement relative to the speaker's position. *Get* shows completed motion. Also, it's more common to use location than motion.

Location: 

 > I'm already at work.


Motion: 

> I've already arrived at / got to/ / made it to work).

**Come**: motion towards the speaker  
**Go**: general motion  
**Get**: completed motion  

I'm still at work in this case: 

> I **came** to work at 9 AM this morning.

Now I'm not referencing my current location:

> I **go** to work everyday. 

The emphasis is on the completed action, not my current location: 

> I **got** to work at 9 AM this morning.

An easy trick is to put *here* in a sentence with *come*. If it doesn't fit, use **get** or **go** instead.

## by / until

*Until* shows how long an action is going to take place.

> Я буду в Киеве до пятницы.    
> I'll be in Kyiv **until** Friday. 

Use *by* for deadlines.

> Мне надо доделать этот проект до пятницы.  
> I have to finish the project **by** Friday.

## feel (myself)

It sounds awkward to say *feel myself* with an adjective. Drop *myself* from these sentences: 

> I feel tired.

We can use *feel myself* with a gerund.

> I was so tired that I could **feel myself** falling asleep.

## make / do a mistake  

We *make mistakes*. We never do mistakes.

## Latinate vocabulary

Watch for register. These are all day-to-day words in Russian: 


> Общение с собеседником про знакомых

Don't translate them with super formal, Latin words: 

> `*`&nbsp;Communication with an interlocutor regarding acquaintances.

Go for day-to-day words instead: 

> Talking to somebody about people we know.

## I / we, and / with

The same person can't appear in both subject and the object of a sentence.

There are are a minimum of three people in this sentence: 

> We discussed with you...

We join people in the subject with *and* not *with*. *I* always comes last in standard English.

> My friend and I... 

never: 

> I with my friend... 


## borrow / lend

The correct way to use these: 

> I **borrowed** money from the bank.    
> The bank **lent** (loaned) me money.

## Explain to me

*Explain* requires a direct object.

> The CEO **explained** the new product (direct object) to us (indirect object).

We can't drop the direct object, and we have to add *to* before the indirect object. 

> My psychologist is the only one who can **explain me**.   

## Word order in embedded answers 

This is correct: 

> I don't know why people make this mistake.

This is not: 

> `*`&nbsp;I don't know why do people make this mistake.

This isn't a question; drop the do.

Also watch out for the word order change:

> I don't know what time it is.
