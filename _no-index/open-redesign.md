Other sites doing open redesigns inspired me to do one of my own (e.g. [Frank Chimero](https://frankchimero.com/blog/2019/redesign/)). I like to tinker and tweak, so here are my current projects for the site. 

## Digital Gardening 

I really like the idea of a [digital garden](/digital-garden) and thinking in public. I'm working on connecting a few blog posts around topics that I keep coming back to, adding linking content, fleshing out ideas and getting feedback.  

## Minor Page Content

Blogrolls are great. I'm working at adding all of the RSS feeds, podcasts, newsletters I subscribe to into a big list with recommendations. Human curated content > algorithmically curated content. 

Similarly, a human written "uses" page (without affiliate links) says more than any bought and paid for review or post stuffed with affiliate links. 

These are more dorky and fun, but also useful for organizing my own thoughts. 

## Microdata 

I already use semantic HTML5, but there's always room for more! I'm looking at adding more microdata so pages look better in read-it-later services, RSS and reader mode. 

## Typography and CSS tweaks 

I don't like my current underlined links, so will probably be change them to more standard colors. 

Nailing dark mode typography is tricky. I'm still working with colors, letter spacing and the like. 

## Navigation 

My navigation and sitemap are a mess and need updating. 

## Making an official Jekyll theme 

I'd like to make an abstracted version of this site so it's easier for people to clone on GitHub and use elements (or all of it!) for their own sites. This is a long-term thing though…

<!-- 


## Why? 

The site is getting a little clunky with some completely unrelated content areas. I tried tweaking the navigation a bit and that only made things worse. 

A quick peak into my CSS revealed a mess of unused rules. I’m inconsistently using tags and categories in Jekyll. My content is splintered into multiple RSS feeds. 

This is from 4 years of randomly adding this and that with hacks and duct tape. Not bad, but it’s time to start from scratch and do better. 

## My Goals

My site should be fun in the old-school internet sort of way.

I’d like to showcase my better writing, both personal blog posts and professional work, without the clutter of content that’s gone stale. 

The different streams of content (i.e. long form blog posts, more ephemeral posts, portfolio writigns and EFL materials) are both separated from each other yet easy to navigate to. 

All updated need to be united in a single RSS feed. 

A few minor design and typography changes for an overall refresh. 

## The Process 

I first tried doing this in one go. Nope. Made zero real progress because it was always too much. 

Thus I’ve broken this down into smaller, iterative chunks.

And to make it even more fun, I’m doing all of this from iPad. 

## To Do 

I'm satisfied with the look and navigation of everything. All that's left is to update the content on some of my pages. 

## Done 

- Design & typography updates
- Refactor CSS and HTML 
- Redo site navigation: header nav, subtitles, footer and homepage
- Add *English Learning* into single RSS feed with the blog posts
- Organize remaining content into more usable categories
- Update Post layout 
- Update Page layout 
- Update Home layout 
- Added the Now page to the main RSS feed but hid it from the blog page. Automated the process of updating it. 
- Redid the content on the Home and About pages so they are no longer overlapping.
- Created [now](/now), [uses](/uses) and [reading](/reading) pages.  
- Made this page. Gotta start somewhere.
