I'm constantly tweaking and changing things here. In the spirit of an open redesign, here are my plans and changes. 

## To Do 

- Add node pages to group content beyond tags (i.e. all posts about learning English, all content about meditation) for key content areas.
- Refactor CSS (it's basically spaghetti code ATM). 
- Update content on all static pages (i.e. portfolio, about, uses, etc.).

## Change Log 

### 2020.12.20

Updated the content on my home, about and uses pages. 

### 2020.11.22

- Added new images and captions to the about page. Now one image is randomly selected on each page load. 

### 2020.11.21

- Changed from master to main branch in GitHub.
- Made minor changes to the style of the nav bar on each page.

### 2020.10.31
